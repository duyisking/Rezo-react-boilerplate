# Getting Started
To run the application, execute the command:
```
npm start
```
After a short time, your default browser will automatically open the app from localhost.
> Note: Your first run may take a litter long time, due to not having cached. But on the next runs, it will be much faster.

You can now start your project by editing the source code located at the `src` directory.
Inside `src`, there are 2 directory `client` - source code of the front-end, and `server` - source code of the back-end. Based on your role, you choose which folder you will work on, or maybe both.

If you find difficulties, see the [Documentations](Documentation.md)
